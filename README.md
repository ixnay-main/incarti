The IRL colony management game.

<hr>

The premise of our problem is this. Luke Skywalker has no convenience store. If C3PO started falling apart Luke cant pop into the hardware store. Did C3PO self-diagnose his problem and order his own parts? What spec are the parts? Where are the blueprints from them, where will they be made? Mos Eisley? Or somewhere with more specialized machinery - how will the parts be transported back? What time frame are we on? If a region can produce 100% of its demand can we say it's fully autonomous? What's the implication for this - could it become sovereign. Could we bootstrap countries with turnkey means of production? <br>
 How much can we automate? If the robots are outmanning(pardon the pun) fields then can humans just kick back for the next eternity? Sounds like a future worth exploring.
