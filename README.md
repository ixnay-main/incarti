The IRL colony management game.

<hr>

The premise of our problem is this. Luke Skywalker has no convinience store. Do the droids self diagnose their problems and order their own parts? What spec are the parts? Where are the blueprints from them, where will they be made? Mos eisly? Or somewhere with more specialised machinery - how will the parts be transported back? What time frame are we on? If a region can produce 100% of its demand can we say its fully autonomous? What's the implication for this - could it become soverign. Could we bootstrap countries with turnkey means of production. <br/> How much can we automate? If the robots are out maning(pardon the pun) fields then can humans just kick back for the next eternity? Sounds like a future worth exploring.
