The IRL colony management game.

<h2>Premise</h2>

Luke Skywalker has no convenience store. If he needs something it turns up on some cargo drone which then zips off again. How do we get that on earth. <br>

Maybe were talking the need for speeder parts. What spec are the parts? Where are the blueprints from, where will they be made? Mos Eisley? Or somewhere with more specialized machinery - how will the parts be transported back? What time frame are we on?

<br>
 What if we automate, and for everything - Crops, houses, clothing. Our only constraint is keeping resourses sustainably produced so we have materials to work.
<br>



If a region can produce 100% of its demand can we say it's fully autonomous? What's the implication for this - could it become sovereign? Could we bootstrap countries with turnkey means of production? <br>
How much can we automate? If the robots are outmanning(pardon the pun) fields then can humans just kick back for the next eternity? Sounds like a future worth exploring.
